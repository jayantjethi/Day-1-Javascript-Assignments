// var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope;
//  let variables can be updated but not re-declared;
// const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
// They are all hoisted to the top of their scope.
// But while var variables are initialized with undefined ,
// let and const variables are not initialized.
