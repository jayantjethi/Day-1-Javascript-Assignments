// There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into 
// three main categories:
// primitive (or primary),
// composite (or reference),
// and special data types.
// String,
// Number, and Boolean
// are primitive data types. 
// Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) 
// are composite data types.
// Whereas Undefined and Null are special data types.

// Primitive data types can hold only one value at a time,
// whereas composite data types can hold collections of values 
// and more complex entities.
